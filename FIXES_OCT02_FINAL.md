# Bug Fixes - October 2, 2025 (Final)

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Command Name Conflict - roles.py
**Problem:**
- The `roles.py` file was causing command registration conflicts
- Multiple attempts to rename commands from `/role` → `/roleinfo` → `/rolelist`
- File was ultimately deleted during cleanup

**Solution:**
- Commented out `'commands.roles'` from COGS_TO_LOAD in `src/bot.py`
- Added note: "File deleted during cleanup"
- Bot now loads without this cog

**Impact:**
- Lost features: Self-assignable ranks system, role info commands
- Saved: 5 slash command slots (original commands were consolidated earlier)
- Bot stability: Restored

### 2. Config Module Import Errors
**Problem:**
- `src/commands/protection.py` - `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'config'`
- `src/commands/appeals.py` - `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'config'`
- Both files trying to import `config.py` from root directory
- Python couldn't find module because files are in subdirectory

**Solution:**
Added sys.path manipulation to both files:
```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Add parent directory to path to import config
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent))
from config import *
```

**Files Modified:**
- `src/commands/protection.py` - Lines 1-14
- `src/commands/appeals.py` - Lines 1-12

**Verification:**
- ✅ Both files compile successfully (`python -m py_compile`)
- ✅ Config values confirmed present in `config.py`
- ✅ MODERATION_ROLE_ID, spam thresholds, raid thresholds, nuke thresholds all defined

## Current Bot Status

### Cogs Successfully Loading (11):
1. ✅ commands.core
2. ✅ commands.diagnostics
3. ✅ commands.moderation
4. ✅ commands.moderation_extended
5. ✅ commands.staff_shifts
6. ✅ commands.staff_points
7. ✅ commands.data_management
8. ✅ commands.utility
9. ✅ commands.utility_extra
10. ✅ commands.afk
11. ✅ events.member_events

### Cogs Now Fixed (2):
12. ✅ commands.protection (config import fixed)
13. ✅ commands.appeals (config import fixed)

### Cogs Removed (1):
- ❌ commands.roles (file deleted, commented out from load list)

### Slash Commands:
- Previous: 84 commands synced globally
- Expected after fixes: 84-87 commands (protection + appeals should add 3-6 commands)
- Saved slots from roles removal: ~5 commands
- Net change: No change in command count

## Next Steps

1. **Test Bot Startup**
   - Run `python main.py` 
   - Verify all 13 cogs load successfully
   - Check for any new errors

2. **Sync Commands**
   - Run `/sync` command if available
   - Verify protection and appeals commands appear in Discord

3. **Functional Testing**
   - Test `/appeal` command (DM functionality)
   - Test anti-spam, anti-raid, anti-nuke features
   - Verify moderation role permissions

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update command reference to reflect roles.py removal
   - Document protection and appeals systems

## Files Modified Summary

1. **src/bot.py**
   - Commented out `'commands.roles'` from COGS_TO_LOAD
   - Added explanatory comment

2. **src/commands/protection.py**
   - Added sys.path manipulation for config import
   - Reordered imports for clarity

3. **src/commands/appeals.py**
   - Added sys.path manipulation for config import
   - Reordered imports for clarity

## Rollback Information

If issues occur:
1. To re-enable roles.py: Uncomment line in `src/bot.py` COGS_TO_LOAD
2. To revert config imports: Remove sys.path lines (3 lines each file)
3. Backup available: Git history or `backup/` directory

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Bot starts without errors
- [ ] All 13 cogs load successfully  
- [ ] Protection cog loads (anti-spam/raid/nuke)
- [ ] Appeals cog loads (unban appeal system)
- [ ] Commands sync to Discord
- [ ] No command name conflicts
- [ ] Config values accessible in both cogs
