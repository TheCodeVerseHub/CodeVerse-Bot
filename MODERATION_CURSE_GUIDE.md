# ðŸ”¨ Moderation Curse System Guide

## Overview
The Moderation Curse System is an advanced, curse-point-based infraction tracking mechanism that automatically manages user behavior through a fair and transparent system. When users violate rules, they receive "curse points" - not achievements, but punishments. The system includes monthly resets, automatic bans at 100 curse points, and a 2-moderator approval system for unbans.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features

### 1. **Curse Point-Based Infractions**
- Moderators add curse points to users for rule violations
- Curse range: 1-100
- Cap: 100 curse points (automatic ban when reached)
- **Monthly automatic reset** - Curse points reset to 0 at the start of each month

### 2. **Automatic Ban System**
- When a user reaches 100 curse points, they are **automatically banned**
- The system sends them a DM with:
  - Ban notification
  - Reason for ban
  - Instructions for requesting an unban

### 3. **2-Moderator Unban Approval**
- Unban requests require approval from **2 different moderators**
- Prevents abuse and ensures fair decisions
- Once approved, user is unbanned and curse is lifted (reset to 0)

### 4. **User Notifications (DMs)**
- Users receive DMs when:
  - They receive curse points
  - They approach 80+ curse points (warning)
  - They are banned at 100 curse points
  - Their unban request is approved and curse is lifted

### 5. **Complete History Tracking**
- All infractions are logged with timestamps
- Monthly infraction history available
- Tracks which moderator issued points

## ðŸ”„ How It Works

### Monthly Reset System
```
Current Month: 2025-10
- User receives curse points throughout October
- On November 1st, curse automatically resets to 0
- Infraction history is preserved for records
```

### Auto-Ban Flow
```
1. User receives curse points â†’ Total reaches 100
2. System automatically bans the user
3. User receives DM:
   - "You've been banned for reaching 100 curse points"
   - "Contact a moderator to request unban"
4. Moderator can submit unban request on their behalf
```

### Unban Approval Flow
```
1. Moderator A: /unbanrequest @User "They've apologized"
   â†’ Request created (0/2 approvals)

2. Moderator B: /approveunban 123456789
   â†’ First approval recorded (1/2 approvals)

3. Moderator C: /approveunban 123456789
   â†’ Second approval recorded (2/2 approvals)
   â†’ User is automatically unbanned
   â†’ Curse lifted (reset to 0)
   â†’ User receives success DM
```

## ðŸ“Š Database Structure

### Tables Created
1. **`moderation_points`** - Main user curse tracking
2. **`infractions`** - Complete infraction/curse history
3. **`unban_approvals`** - Tracks moderator approvals

### Data Location
- Database: `data/moderation_points.db`
- Auto-created on first use
- Persistent across bot restarts

## ðŸŽ¨ Curse Point Recommendation Guide

Suggested curse point values for common infractions:

| Infraction | Curse Points | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Minor spam | 5-10 | First-time, small amount |
| Excessive spam | 15-25 | Repeated or disruptive |
| Inappropriate language | 10-15 | Mild profanity/rudeness |
| Harassment | 25-40 | Targeting users |
| Hate speech | 50-75 | Serious violation |
| NSFW content | 30-50 | Depending on severity |
| Raid participation | 75-100 | Immediate serious action |
| Advertising/Scams | 40-60 | Commercial spam |

**Note:** These are recommendations. Adjust based on your server's rules and severity.

## ðŸ”’ Security & Fairness Features

### 1. **2-Moderator Approval**
- Prevents single moderator from having too much power
- Ensures community consensus on unbans
- Different moderators required (can't approve twice)

### 2. **Monthly Reset**
- Gives users fresh starts
- Prevents permanent "cursed records"
- Encourages long-term good behavior

### 3. **Transparent System**
- Users can check their own curse anytime
- All curses are logged and timestamped
- Complete infraction history available

### 4. **Automatic Notifications**
- Users are always informed about curse points received
- Warnings at 80+ curse points prevent surprises
- Clear instructions for appeal process

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

1. **Cannot curse bots** - System prevents this automatically
2. **Curse range: 1-100** - Cannot add negative curse points
3. **Monthly reset is automatic** - Curse lifted at start of month
4. **Ban at 100 is automatic** - Maximum curse triggers auto-ban
5. **Unban requires 2 moderators** - Cannot be bypassed (except with direct `/unban`)

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### User didn't receive DM?
- User may have DMs disabled
- Bot logs will show "Cannot send DM" message
- Inform them manually through server channels

### How to check who approved an unban?
- Use `/pendingunbans` to see approval counts
- Check bot logs for moderator names

### Can we change the 100 curse point limit?
- Currently hardcoded to 100
- Contact bot developer to modify

### What happens to old curses/infractions?
- They're preserved in the database
- Can be viewed with `/viewcurse`
- Monthly reset only affects curse total, not history

## ðŸ“ˆ Best Practices

1. **Be Consistent:** Use similar curse values for similar infractions
2. **Warn First:** For minor first-time offenses, consider warnings before cursing
3. **Document Reasons:** Always provide clear reasons when adding curse
4. **Review Regularly:** Check `/pendingunbans` frequently
5. **Communicate:** Let your community know about the curse system

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Tips

- **Post rules with curse values** so users know consequences
- **Train moderators** on consistent curse assignment
- **Use `/viewcurse`** before banning to see history
- **Be fair with unban approvals** - give genuine second chances
- **Monitor monthly resets** - announce curse lifts to community
